        <h4 style="margin: 0 0 2.5vmin 5vmin">Video</h4>
        <p>Video games have been a huge part of my life for almost as long as I can remember. For the most part I was the only child at home and
          video games were a great way to entertain myself when I was all alone. The first time I experienced a video game was when I was 5 years
          old, my parents had bought a PlayStation for the family and had picked up Smurf Racer. I couldn’t get enough and my love of gaming has
          continued ever since. Over the years I have tried a wide variety of games and genres, it became my way of having fun even with no one
          else around, a way that I could have my own adventure. Eventually I was introduced to online gaming, which brought about two new aspects
          into my life. The first being a competitive attitude and the second being a new way to meet and make friends. Throughout the years I would
          meet people online who would become some of my closest friends to this very day. For me, video games have created an avenue not only for
          fun and recreation, but also for friendship and opportunity.</p>

        <p style="clear:right">Whenever there is mention of my grandfather the first thing that comes to my mind is card games. Card games were a big
          part of my family growing up, it seemed like any time we were gathered with family people were playing cards. As I got older I began to join
          in on the fun and learned all about the games that were being played – mainly Uno and Skip-Bo. I discovered quickly the same love for games
          that my grandfather had and throughout my life it developed further into all sorts of tabletop games. I would come to both try and enjoy a
          wide variety of tabletop and party games. Whenever I am able to gather with a group of friends or family it is often accustomed to have at
          least one good game session in our time together. It gives us all a sense of bonding and friendly competition often accompanied by lots of
          laughter and smiles. I will never forget playing with my grandfather and all the joy that it brought both to him and everyone around him.
          Every time I play I am reminded of him and decide to play just as he would, to win!</p>

          <h5>Horror</h5>
          <p>I love horror movies. Point and case, it is by far my favorite genre for films. I enjoy many aspects of the films no matter what their
            intent was. I enjoy the scares that they can give, the laughs at some of the more comedic titles, and of course picking apart the situation
            and all the bad choices the characters in the film are making – like opening up the door that just closed for no reason. My favorite films
            in this genre usually involve stories about the paranormal, to me the unknown is scarier than the usual gory serial killer films. However
            anything apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic is a close second – after all, who doesn’t like a good zombie flick!</p>

          <p style="clear:right">The adrenaline, the fast-paced scenes, the battle against all odds, the ACTION. Who can say no to action movies? It’s
            the battle of good against evil, the underdog overcoming all odds and the story of heroism. Many of these films have me on the edge of my
            seat, rooting for my favorite character to prevail or complete their rite of passage. These movies often give me the feeling that I am in
            drivers seat and are a great way to live vicariously in ways I never could. I could be a warrior in a foreign land, a magical wizard or a
            super hero with powers beyond my wildest dreams. These movies often help to cheer me up after having a bad day and allow me to feel like I
            can accomplish anything.</p>

          <h5>Sci-Fi</h5>
          <p>The unknown, the unexplored and a glimpse into a possible future this is exactly what science fiction is to me. Every day we learn and
            discover more and more about both the world we live in and the world outside of our own and to me sci-fi films just push us further to
            discovery and creation. Ideas that people have put on the big screen inspiring generation after generation to come up with the next
            technological advancement. I watch these movies and all I can think about is when the films will go from being fiction to reality. When
            will we be creating spaceships to travel through space at the speed of light, discovering a new species in the galaxy or creating weapons
            that shoot laser beams. Sci-fi films keep our minds thinking and driving us forward in a world of ever changing and advancing technology.</p>

          <p style="clear:right">Sitcoms are my go to show for a quick video session and a usual pick me up during any point of the day. Usually I
            find myself looking for a shorter show length due to the versatility of being able to get the whole store in a mere 20 minutes. It feels
            like I can fit more into my time especially when I am limited to how long I can spend watching. Great for lunch breaks, short late night
            viewings, while you let dinner cook or while you eat it! Being able to see the same group of people day in and day out almost makes me feel
            like a part of the crew! Watching them live their lives day to day and seeing all the funny and crazy things that happen can help laugh
            away some of the stress that accumulates in my own life. I always have one of these on the go to help fill up the little spaces in my day
            when I just need a laugh and a break from everything else.</p>

          <h5>Action</h5>
          <p>Depending on the show and how you look at it, these types of shows can either be one short movie with many sequels, or one long movie
            with many acts. Either way you look at it you’re winning! Personally for me it is a little bit of both. I enjoy the fact that I do not
            have to commit to a 2 hour viewing session just to see an action film, but also that I can go on one long journey with appropriate breaks
            in between getting lots of detail along the way. Don’t get me wrong action movies are great, but I often feel a want for more, and with a
            television series I can get just that. To me one season is just one long movie and each episode is an act. I get to see more character
            development, attention to detail and an overall longer and more in-depth story. I usually have one of these on the go at any given time
            and try to squeeze in an episode whenever I am able.</p>

          <h5>Anime</h5>
          <p>For those of you that don’t know anime refers to Japanese animation. I often enjoy animated film, I mean after all who doesn’t like Disney
            or Looney Tunes? What sets anime apart from this however, is that it isn’t all just cartoons and thelike, but involves a spectrum of
            everything under the sun! Ninjas, pirates, martial arts fighters, wizards, video games, teen drama, sports! If you can think of it, there
            is most likely an anime about it. Another thing is that not all these shows are aimed at a young age group, many are of a suggested age
            range 13 and older. I enjoy that I can still watch films about topics that I enjoy or in genres that I normally watch in an animated styling.
            Most are only 20 minutes long too so they are easy to fit into my day to day schedule or just binge when I have the time. If you haven’t
            watched anime before, I highly recommend you give it a try!</p>

        <p>Remember using your imagination as a kid to take you anywhere and make you anything? Well I do this on a near weekly basis. Every week
          on Sunday I get together with a group of friends to play Dungeons and Dragons. Dungeons and Dragons is one of the most well-known and
          best-selling role-playing games of all time, reaching over 40 years of active play. Dungeons and Dragons is a fantastic way to become
          someone else and do things that you would probably never be able to do within your own day to day life. Whether you are a barbarian
          wielding a giant great axe, a mystical elf able to transform into all kinds of creatures or a dragonborn throwing out devastating spells!
          There is something for everyone in this game and the fact that you can play it almost anywhere at any point in time makes it that much
          better! Create a story and have it unfold before you where everyone’s choices matter. Relive your childhood days and let your imagination
          soar to new heights. Dungeons and Dragons has been something I look forward to every week for a great few hours of companionship, laughs
          and incredible stories.</p>

        <p style="clear:right">Before there was film, radio or Dungeons and Dragons there was books! The original way to go on an adventure from the
          comfort of your home, using your imagination to depict stories and adventures and envision fantasy after fantasy using the words on paper
          to create your vision. Nowadays many books end up getting a movie or television series somewhere down the road, however as any book
          enthusiast will tell you it just isn’t the same. Often times you envision things differently, or details from the book are excluded. Often
          times you have to treat the two as entirely separate entities, enjoying them both for what they have to offer and not comparing them to find
          what they do not. This is exactly what I try and do. Whenever I need a break from the screen and just want to relax, I find a book where I
          can escape to another world and learn all about it and the people that reside there. Imagining what it would be like to be a part of that
          universe and reading in awe and wonder about the adventures the characters have and the world that they live in.</p>
