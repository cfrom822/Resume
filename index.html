      <p>My name is Colin and I am still quite new to the world of coding. I am currently attending the Software Development Diploma Program at
        Bow Valley College in order to achieve the information I need to pursue a career in Software Development.<br>
        I have worked in a variety of work environments doing a number of different jobs up until this point. A few of the areas I have experience
        working in are concessions, warehouse operations, lot coordination and steamfitting.<br>
        I have been on a computer for a long time now and I was always intrigued with the idea of designing programs and applications both to
        assist people in their day to day lives and bring fun and entertainment.<br>
        I have a passion for video games, math and puzzles and I think this is a large part of what has attracted me to this field of work. I am excited
        for my future and cannot wait to get out there and show the world what I can do.

          <div class="Experience">
            <h4>Compass Energy</h4>
            <h5 style="text-align:right">2018-2021</h5>
            <p>My time at Compass Energy was one of my biggest workplace learning experiences to this day. I started off as a laborer with very
              little knowledge and little to no skills, but in my 3 years there I gained a plethora of knowledge and skills and came out as a
              third year apprentice steamfitter. I worked in a variety of areas including shipping and receiving, hydro testing, and assembly. I also
              obtained training in operating forklifts and overhead cranes. In my time there I further developed skills such as working in a fast paced
              environment, working in both large and small team settings and learning to adapt quickly based on the situation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="Experience">
            <h4>CanaDream</h4>
            <h5 style="text-align:right">2017-2018</h5>
            <p>My time at CanaDream was a shorter experience but really helped me further develop some critical skills. Every day was a different
              experience with new problems and new solutions to be found. I was able to not only work with groups of different people within the company
              but also new people from all around the world. Working in a fast paced environment where the situation could change at any moment really
              helped me focus on my critical thinking and problem solving. Another important development was my social skills including conflict resolution
              both with staff and guests. Overall my time there taught me a lot about being able to think things through quickly and come to a resolution
              everyone could agree on.</p>

            <h4>Calaway Park</h4>
            <h5 style="text-align:right">2012-2016</h5>
            <p>I had the pleasure of working at Calaway Park for 4 summer seasons and as part of my early work experience I can say that it had
              a major impact on how I perform at work to this very day. I worked and assisted in multiple departments in my time there and in turn was
              able to begin to learn and develop key skills that would continue to help me not only in the workplace but also outside of it. General work
              ethic as well as teamwork and leadership skills, problem solving and critical thinking.</p>
